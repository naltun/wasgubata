### wasguwhat?

wasgubata is a utility that fetches geolocation information for IP addresses and domains. It is written
in TypeScript for [Deno](https://deno.land).

### Installation

TBD

### Manifesto

wasgubata is opinionated software. By that I mean, the developer behind the code has values they would
like to share with you. Do you have a moment?

Although a modest utility, I am proud to write this software for Deno. Here's why...

The Deno core developers are taking a risk, a wild gamble that maybe, just maybe their software will change
the world for the better. I find this alluring. Let me explain:

The core developers...
They believe that software should be secure by default.
They believe that development experience matters.
They believe in having fun.

If you share these ideals, there is something you must know first.

Deno is new software, which is quite scary! What this means is the software is largely untested in
production, and that it has yet to face the gaunlet of proving its technology. But that's OK, because
we have the Deno community and leadership.

This ragtag band of daredevils are willing to take a chance on a better
future for tech, and they mean business! Standing on the shoulders of giants, they gaze over the heads
of naysayers and march towards a world where compromises don't have to be made.

This is the world I want to live in, a wonderful world of robust and secure software, with happy users
AND happy developers!

Those who have fun, move fast, encourage community, and take chances are leading the way.

To put it simply, our ideas are:<br />
Kick butt<br />
Have fun<br />
Change the world
